- cdd without argument
![cdd1](docs/imgs/cdd_cdd.gif)

- auto completion with number
![cdd1](docs/imgs/cdd_comp4.gif)

If you press `TAB` after command + `space`, `../` will be poped up then you can navigate from the parent directory. Double `TAB` also show directories which is in the directory.  


## Setup  

- Automatically (only for bash)

````sh
 $ source setup.sh
````

- Manually

1. Generate a symbolic link in your $PATH

```
ln -s $CUR_PATH/cdd.sh $SET_DIR/cdd
```
> `$CUR_PATH`: this script path where you've cloned.  
> `$SET_DIR`: the path where you want to make symlink in.  
> Note that symlink name shoule be cdd (not cdd.sh)  

2. Append follow lines in your rc file

```
# for script cdd
source $SET_DIR/cdd
[ -f $CUR_PATH/cdd-completion.bash ] \
        && source $CUR_PATH/cdd-completion.bash
```
